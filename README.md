# Anno-1800-SharedMods--for-Modders-
 Anno 1800 shared mods for modders, helpful utility-like mods

Shared mods from other modders: https://github.com/anno-mods/shared-resources

## Code
1) [xml Anno codesnippets](./CodeSnippets.md)
2) [python tools codesnippets](./CodeSnippetsPython.md)

## How to Download  

Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and hit "download zip" to download the complete collection. Of course you can delete the mods you don't want after download (I know no way to only download a single folder from github).

## Usage  

All shared mods are intended to not be changed from other modders except the author/s. So you copy paste the desired shared mod into your mod folder, which will automatically enable the shared mod together with your mod. If you want to make iprovements to any shared mod, do a PR to this repository. If you want to change things/texts that are not suited for everyone, do this within your own mod instead, by loading your mod after my shared mod and then do ModOp changes like usual to it.  
  
For detailed explanation what a shared mod does, read the modinfo description and open the xml files from the mod, I added tons of explaining comments.
